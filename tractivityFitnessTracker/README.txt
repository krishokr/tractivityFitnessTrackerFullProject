Fitness tracker part 3. 

Allows user to enter activities, sends activities to the Express server, the server stores activities in a SQLITE database, and resends them back to the client for display in a bar graph using D3.

If a user enters a future activity, the app reminds the user on that date to log that activity.

User can also login and log out of the server using Passport through Google.
